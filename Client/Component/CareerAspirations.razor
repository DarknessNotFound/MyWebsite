			<Tab />After graduation, I am hoping to be in a job where I get to use my programming knowledge to solve math-based problems. My current plan is to go into data science post-graduation as that is a great combination of problem solving and programming. I eventually want to end up leading a small team of developers in solving these types of problems. My goal is to be the guy where my co-workers can depend on me for both my analytical expertise as well as non-technical skills.
